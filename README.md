The aim of this project is to address the current challenges around the breeding of Yellow-Billed Hornbills in the Kalahari, South Africa.
A recent increase in climate temperatures is causing the artificial nest boxes to overheat, causing the hornbills to frequently
abandon breeding attempts. As a result of this, experts have predicted that the Yellow-Billed Hornbills will go extinct in the next 
50 years. Our system will monitor temperature and humidity data in the nest, as well as implement some temperature control 
to the nest.
